![Pod](pod.svg)
## üìå Definition

- What it is:
  The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A Pod is an abstraction that represents one or more tightly coupled containers that share the same network namespace and storage volumes

- How useful it is:
  Pods allow you to run applications in containers but manage them with Kubernetes features like scaling, self-healing, and networking. They provide the foundation for deploying and running workloads in Kubernetes.

- How to implement:
  You typically define a Pod in a YAML manifest (`pod.yaml`) and create it using¬†`kubectl apply -f pod.yaml`. Example:
  ```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: my-container
    image: nginx

  ```

- Simple analogy:
  Think of a¬†**Pod as a small tent**¬†at a festival. Inside the tent (Pod), you may have one person (container) or a small group of people (multiple containers) sharing the same space, electricity, and supplies (network and storage).

- Problem it solves:
  Running raw containers directly doesn‚Äôt provide orchestration features like networking, scaling, or lifecycle management. Pods solve this by being the Kubernetes wrapper around containers, allowing them to be scheduled, networked, and managed seamlessly.

- My thoughts:
  Pod is the smallest part of the Kubernetes. It allows to start simple container app with shared resources between them. But it also provides a bunch of different security, safety, advantages.
