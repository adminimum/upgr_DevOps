## üìå Definition

- What it is:
  A higher-level Kubernetes object that manages¬†**ReplicaSets**¬†and ensures Pods are running in a desired state.

- How useful it is:
	-  Provides¬†**declarative updates**¬†(rollouts, rollbacks).
	- Manages scaling up/down automatically.
	- Ensures self-healing (recreates failed Pods).
	- Simplifies managing multiple versions of applications.

- How to implement:
  You create a¬†**Deployment YAML manifest**, apply it with¬†`kubectl apply -f`, and Kubernetes ensures Pods are created, updated, and maintained.

- Simple analogy:
  A Deployment is like a¬†**project manager**: you tell it¬†_‚ÄúI want 3 workers (Pods), running this app version‚Äù_. The manager makes sure there are always exactly 3 workers, replaces lazy ones, and smoothly swaps them when a new version arrives.

- Problem it solves:
	- Automates scaling, rollout, and rollback of apps.
	- Handles failures gracefully.
	- Provides a consistent way to manage stateless apps without manual intervention.

- My thoughts:
  Deployment is that type of elements in kubernetes that extend abilities of the ReplicaSet objects. And add these functionalities as Autoscaling, rollouts and updates.
