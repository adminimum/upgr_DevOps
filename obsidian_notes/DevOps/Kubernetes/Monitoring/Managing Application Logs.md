## üìå Description

- Application logs provide insights into the behavior and health of workloads running in the cluster.
- Monitoring them helps detect errors, performance issues, and unexpected behavior.
- Typically implemented with logging agents (e.g., Fluentd, Fluent Bit, or Logstash) that ship logs to centralized storage and monitoring tools (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki, or Cloud Logging).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Implementation

1. **Sidecar or DaemonSet log collectors**
    - Deploy a DaemonSet (Fluentd, Fluent Bit) on each node to collect logs from¬†`/var/log/containers`.
    - Alternatively, use a sidecar container per pod to capture and forward logs.
        
2. **Centralized log storage**
    - Send logs to Elasticsearch, Loki, or cloud-native solutions (e.g., GCP Logging, AWS CloudWatch, Azure Monitor).
        
3. **Visualization and alerting**
    - Integrate with Grafana, Kibana, or Lens for log queries and dashboards.

## ‚úÖ Advantages

- Centralized log management makes troubleshooting faster.
- Real-time monitoring and alerting for critical errors.
- Helps correlate application issues with cluster events.
- Improves observability in multi-tenant and large-scale environments.

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands

```bash
# View logs of a specific pod
kubectl logs my-pod

# View logs of a specific container inside a pod
kubectl logs my-pod -c my-container

# Stream logs in real time
kubectl logs -f my-pod

# Check logs across multiple pods using a selector
kubectl logs -l app=my-app --all-containers=true

```
