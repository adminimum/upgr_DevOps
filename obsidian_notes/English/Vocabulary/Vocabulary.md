1. **Context is Key**: Learn words in context (e.g., sentences) to understand usage and meaning, rather than memorizing isolated definitions.
2. **Repetition Builds Retention**: Regularly review words (e.g., spaced repetition) to move them from short-term to long-term memory.
3. **Word Families Matter**: Understand related forms (e.g., learn, learning, learned) to expand vocabulary efficiently.
4. **Active Use Enhances Mastery**: Practice using new words in speaking or writing to solidify understanding.
5. **Chunking Improves Recall**: Group words into themes or phrases (e.g., time expressions: soon, later, now) for better retention.
