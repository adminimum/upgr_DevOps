Make me template for kubernetes deployment. But it should store all possible fields. I need all. 
And they should meet once. 
If filed can be used a multiple times (like for example label) . Put the comment nearby with this text "Multiple" 
If filed requires string format input. Put the comment nearby with text "String"
if filed requires number input. Put the comment nearby with the text "Number"
if filed requires one option from multiple but predefined. Put comment like "Predefined {In, NotIn, Exists...}
If field has multiple comments, write them like "Number,Multiple"
Obviously Optional should have comment optional, mandatory should have "mandatory".
If it's array, comment "Array"
If it's map, comment "Map"
If filed can be replaced by another field, no matter with different sub options or with the same, Just make the comment "Replaceable{FieldName,FiledName,...}
If field exclude another filed, or option, add comment Exclude{full yaml path what excluded. Example:spec.stratagy.rollingupdate.maxsurge}
